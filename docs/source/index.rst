About
=====

The following applications have been developed for the detection of trends in geoscientific data
in a semi-automated fashion. The applications are designed with a user-interface to be used in conjunction with
`Geoscience ANALYST <https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst/>`_ and its
`geoh5 format <https://mirageoscience-geoh5py.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/stable/content/geoh5_format/index.html>`_,
open storage format.
